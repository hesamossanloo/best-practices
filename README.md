# best-practices
An ongoing project to capture best-practices learned throughout time for software development

I started this project to hopefully get enough people interested in the doing things in a better way.

###### Disclaimer
Best-practices discussed here are mostly subjective and open to debate. I'd love for someone to 
challenge these arguments and educate me on learning a better way of doing things.
